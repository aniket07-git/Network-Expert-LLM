We were successfully able to train a large language model, specifically Llama 3.2 model with 1 billion parameters on a wireless specification document.\n","\n","2. We didn't anticipate that doing unsupervised pre-training will make the model forget instruction following.\n","\n","3. To counter this, we did supervised instruction tuning of the model on question and answer pairs from the wireless specification handbook. These question answer pairs were generated with the help of ChatGPT as its a much more powerful and capable model.\n","\n","4. After supervised instruction tuning the model was able to converse in a natural language which is more human and assistant like.\n","\n","5. This demonstrates that the pipeline works and can be used to scale to much bigger models given the compute.\n","\n","\n","\n","Some Limitations of the current work:\n","\n","1. Since we did not have access to a lot of compute, we could only do both types of finetuning for one epoch, because google colab does not allow runtime for more than 3-4 hours.\n","2. This restricted the number of experiments that could be done and hence the finetuned model might not necessarily perform better than the original model.\n","3. It is also possible that the original model had more generalized knowledge which was forgotten by finetuning on our small text. A better method might be to do unsupervised finetuning on much more Wireless Network literature like books and Research papers so that the model is specialized but also knowledgable across a broad range of topics in wireless communication."],"metadata":{"id":"gV3dZUPnJEEz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"0XawE43nJFiB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
